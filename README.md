## Project Requirements

Our project is to build an online, multiplayer version of the tabletop game: Betrayal at House on the Hill.

To accomplish this, the following will be required:

1. The ability for multiple players (3-6) to play the game over the internet.
2. The game's boards layout, 3 levels, and tile generation.
3. Both private and public spaces -- the players all see the board but also get private information for the specific tasks.
4. An implementation of the game's phases of pre haunt and post haunt.
5. Implementation of items, omens, and events (cards that you can draw).
6. Characters that players can choose between, each with its own stats.
7. Implementations of several different haunts (which are different scenarios and goals depending on the situation).
8. Customizable players, haunts, and perhaps even items, omens, and events.
