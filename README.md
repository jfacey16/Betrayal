## Project Requirements

Our project is to build an online, multiplayer version of the tabletop game: Betrayal at House on the Hill.

To accomplish this, the following will be required:

1. The ability for multiple players (3-6) to play the game over the internet.
2. Implementing the game's boards layout for all 3 levels, as well as the specific tiles and tile generation.
3. Both private and public spaces -- the players all see the board and other playersâ€™ items/stats; however, certain players will also receive private information necessary for specific tasks (specifically in regards to the haunts).
4. An implementation of the game's phases of pre haunt and post haunt.
5. Implementation of items, omens, and events (cards that you can draw).
6. Characters that players can choose between, each with its own stats.
7. Implementations of several different haunts (which are different scenarios and goals depending on the situation).  This will include implementing traitors, different monsters, different items, and custom rule sets depending on the haunt chosen during the game play.
8. Implementation of a publicly visible track numbered 0-12 that will be incremented and decremented. 

All of these are essential aspects to the tabletop game, so we feel that it is important to implement these.
